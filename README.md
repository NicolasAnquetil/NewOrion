# NewOrion
A new implementation of the Orion project allowing to represent incremental versions of a Famix model.

Based on initial work by Jannik Laval:

Laval, Denier, Ducasse, Falleri, "Supporting simultaneous versions for software evolution assessment", *Science of Computer Programming* 76 (12), 1177-1193

This version uses slots to transparently access the right entities in a given version of a model
